INSTALLATION
=======================


1. REQUIRED LIBRARIES
=======================

In order for TARP to work the following libraries are needed:

-- OpenSSL v 0.9.7f or higher
-- libpcap v 2.4 or higher
-- libnet  v 1.1.2.1  
-- libnetlink v 020116

OpenSSL and libpcap are normally installed by default
with many linux distributions.

libnet can be downloaded from fedora extra's project website.
http://fedoraproject.org/extras/4/i386/repodata/repoview/libnet-devel-0-1.1.2.1-6.fc4.html

libnetlink is part of the iproute2 package. To install libnetlink you can either install iproute2 or install libnetlink by itself.

You can download iproute2 from:
 	http://developer.osdl.org/dev/iproute2/download/

or download libnetlink library from:
http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/684220/com/libnetlink-devel-2.4.7.ss020116-10@2.4.20_6.i386.rpm.html

Copy the libnetlink.a file to /usr/lib/ and libnetlink.h to /usr/include

2. TARP KERNEL MODULE INSTALLATION
==================================

In order to compile the tarp_mod loadable kernel module (LKM), you will 
need to have your kernel souce files. For information on how to install 
and compile your linux kernel, please consult your linux distribution user guide.

1. Extract source code files:

	tar xvf tarp.tar

2. Compile Tarp module:

	'cd' to module directory and type 'make'

3. Install the tarp_mod module:
   
	type 'make install'
   
   This will copy the tarp_mod to the approperiate modules directory
   on your system.
   
4. Regenerate modules.dep and map files:

   type 'depmod -a'

5. Load the tarp_mod module:

   type 'modprobe tarp_mod'

Note: You can also load the kernel by typing 'insmod tarp_mod.ko' 
   To unload the kernel type 'rmmod tarp_mod'
   
Note: To have tarp startup at boot time. Add 'modprobe tarp_mod' to your startup scripts.


3. TARP DAEMON INSTALLATION
================================

1. Compile tarpd daemon
   
   'cd' to src directory and type 'make'

2. Install the tarp daemon:

   type 'make install'

   This will copy the tarpd to the approperiate directory
   on your system.
   
	tarpd is copied to /usr/bin
	tarp_conf, known_hosts, ex_pub_key, ex_ticket are all copied
	into /etc/tarp

   tarp_conf is the main configuration file for TARP. 

4. TARP CONFIGURATION
===============================

In order to use TARP in your network, you will need to generate
a network private/public key pair. The private key is used by the
server (lta) to generate tarp tickets. While the public key is used
by hosts to check ticket validity.

1. Compile tarp configuration tools: 

   'cd' to lta directory and type 'make'


2. Generate private/public key pair files

   type 'lta_genkeys FILE_NAME 1024 1'
   where FILE_NAME is a prefix for the key files

3. Use the private key file to generate tickets for machines 
   that will run tarp

   type 'lta MAC IP PRIVATE_KEY_FILE > TICKET_FILE'

8. Copy the ticket files to each machine that will be running tarp.
   The ticket file should be copied to the directory indicated in your tarp configuration file (tarp_conf).


KNOWN HOSTS CONFIGURATION
================================

Known hosts are hosts on your network that are not running TARP.
For example this could be a network printer that is not running TARP.
By adding an IP address to your knwon hosts file a TARP host will accept
classic unsigned ARP packets for that IP address.

1. Edit your known hosts configuration file
   Each line in the known_hosts file represents a range of IP addresses
   For example:
      192.168.0.1 192.168.0.10

   This will include 10 IP addresses in your known hosts.

RUNNING TARPD
==================================

To run tarp:
	type '/usr/bin/tarpd'
	
	by default tarpd will user /etc/tarp/tarp_conf as the default configuration file.

To stop tarpd:

	ps -e | grep tarp
	kill 12345

	where 1234 is the process id of tarpd
